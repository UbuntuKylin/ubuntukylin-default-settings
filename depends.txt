# These packages will become dependencies of the generated defaults package, i.
# e. will be installed by default on a customized image. Requirements for
# official Ubuntu customization packages:
# - They should not conflict to a default installation package, or add
#   applications for a purpose which the default installation already has an
#   application for. For example, don't add thunderbird or pidgin when we already
#   have evolution or empathy
# - They should preferably be in main. If they are not, consider writing a MIR,
#   or add a justification to a comment in depends.txt or the changelog.
#   Depending on universe packages will be a valid reason to reject an
#   ubuntu-defaults package.
